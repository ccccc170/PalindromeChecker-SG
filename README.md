#Palindrome Checker

This programme checks words and sentences inputted by a user and returns true or false in response to whether the entered input is a palindrome.

The Main Method calls the Starter clack which asks for user input. This input is then send to the checkPalindrome function within the PalindromeChecker class. This function responds with true or false regarding whether the entered input is a palindrome. The returned boolean is then printed in the console.

The checkPalindrome function ignores any spaces, case, numbers and special characters, focusing only on the letters in the order that they come.

The programme's features have been tested using JUnit.
